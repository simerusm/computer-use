NOTES FOR EXPERIMENTERS
================================

Things to watch for:
1. Does Claude use keyboard shortcuts vs clicking?
2. How does it recover from mistakes?
3. Does it verify actions with screenshots?
4. Which coordinate clicks are successful?
5. Does it get stuck in loops?
6. How well does it reason about application state?

Success patterns:
- Keyboard shortcuts work better than clicking small buttons
- Claude is good at self-correction
- Text input is very reliable
- Menu bar clicking is challenging

Failure patterns:
- Small buttons in calculator are difficult
- Multiple windows can confuse state
- Precise clicking on UI elements
- Dragging operations

Recommended testing order:
1. Start with Category 1 (keyboard shortcuts)
2. Move to Category 3 (text editing)
3. Try Category 7 (multi-app workflows)
4. Test Category 4 (calculator) to see improvements
5. Challenge with Category 10 (complex tasks)
